    "intro": "My name is Robbie Verdurme, I was born on 20th of January 1998 in Ghent. I’m graduated with a degree in computer sciences at HoGent. My specialization in my 3th year at HoGent is programming applications for Android and Windows mobile phones. It is a very appealing study as I can put a lot of creativity into code.",
    "primarySchool": "I started my elementary school at Sint Lievens Kolegem. As all new students I was unsure about my future at that point but that school, and it’s great teachers, set me on a path to be a fine adult. I felt really comfortable at that school and still have good memories of it. My fellow students and I made a really close group and still today I see some of them.",
    "highSchool": "My high school was Visitatie Mariakerke and despite the reputation that school had amongst students, it was a great school too. As any institute, it’s the people -in this case the teachers- that makes it great. It's in that school that my interest began to grow for computer sciences.",
    "future": "When I left Visitatie my choice for University was made instantly : It had to be a university where they taught IT, more specifically programming. I wanted to be a programmer. So I went to HoGent.",

The first part is the core functionality that is mainly concerned with the execution of different types of commands. These commands can range from generating a pdf file, an xls file to sending an e-mail. The second part is an extension of the first part. Commands can be executed in another environment than the one on which the command executer is running. For example, you are at school and you want to print to the printer at home. The command executor then communicates with a linked program to pass on the command to print the file at your house.",
